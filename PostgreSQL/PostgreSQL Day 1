What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to interact with databases. It is the standard language for querying, inserting, updating, and managing data stored in relational databases.

Why we use SQL?
1. Simplifies working with large datasets.
2. Enables easy and efficient data management.
3. SQL is universal and works with most database systems (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).

DATA
Anything & Everything can be considered as data.
Any information or fact can be considered as data.
For any Financial Institute, details related to its employees, customers, their Services or even their address can be data.
Data can be in any form such as a text message or an image or a video or a document or single character itself.

What is Database?
A database is collection of Data that can be easily access (Digitally)
A software to manage database is called DBMS (Database Management Software)

Now we are learning Postgre SQL
---------------------------------
Download PostgreSQL from: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
After downloads install on the PC.
Search for pgAdmin 4 and click on Server and give password
This is a IDE tool where can run codes

Types of SQL Commands:
-----------------------
DDL (Data Definition Language)
Used to define or change the structure of database objects (tables, schemas, indexes).
| Command    | Purpose                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE`   | Create database objects                   |
| `ALTER`    | Modify existing objects                   |
| `DROP`     | Delete objects                            |
| `TRUNCATE` | Remove all table data (structure remains) |
| `RENAME`   | Rename an object                          |


DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Used to manage data inside tables.
| Command  | Purpose                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| `INSERT` | Add new records         |
| `UPDATE` | Modify existing records |
| `DELETE` | Remove records          |
| `SELECT` | Retrieve data           |

DCL (Data Control Language)
Used to control access and permissions.
| Command  | Purpose            |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| `GRANT`  | Give permissions   |
| `REVOKE` | Remove permissions |

TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Used to manage transactions (especially important in production systems).
| Command           | Purpose                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `COMMIT`          | Save transaction              |
| `ROLLBACK`        | Undo changes                  |
| `SAVEPOINT`       | Set rollback point            |
| `SET TRANSACTION` | Define transaction properties |
| `BEGIN` 	    | Start transaction             |

DQL (Data Query Language)
Sometimes treated separately, mainly includes:
SELECT : Used only for querying data.

=============================================================
Pro Tip for Beginners
Always use COMMIT and ROLLBACK carefully to avoid unintended changes, especially in critical databases. Practice using SELECT frequently to understand your data before making changes with DML commands.
